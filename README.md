# Challenge #3. JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator

## Password Generator
--------------------------------------------
As an employer it is of outmost importance to protect the assets of a company while maintaining availability. 
This employer came to me to create a program that will output a randomize password within certain criteria in order to maintain security for employee access. 

---------------------------------------------
GIVEN that a new employee needs a new randomize secure password:

>*  When user clicks 'Generate Button'
   - The user is presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
   - The user will have to select a password length between 8 and 128. Invalid inputs such as letters or a number higher/lower than accepted will return an "Invalid" alert.
   - The user will then be asked which type of characters they would like included in their password (Numbers, Special Characters, Upper-Case letters, Lower-Case letters).
>* When each prompt is completed
  - The randomized password will be displayed to the user written on the page
